Project Category 4 - Design and Implementation

The code is commented properly for user readability and it would be easier if you read the source in following order:
1.) Buffer.java
2.) Property.java
3.) Tag.java
4.) TextTag.java
5.) EmptyTag.java
6.) GenericTag.java
7.) HTMLDoc.java
8.) Project.java
9.) Sample.java

Resources used :
1.) ? Oracle 2014 - Java JDK 1.6.0
2.) ? Oracle 2014 - Java version 1.6.0_26
3.) ? Oracle 2014 - Java Documentation
4.) ? Google 2014 - for eliminating bugs
5.) Adarsh Jagannath(PhD student, IIT Kanpur) - for basic structuring of the preprocessor
6.) ? University of Kent - for the software I used while coding in Java -> BlueJ

Group USP:
1.) Parth Mehta - I developed the basic framework that we used. My experience in Java development in the past
                  projects helped me to a great extent, especially the concepts of interitance and the 
                  concept of super-classes and the method of extending them to other classes.
2.)Pranjal Garg - Together with Parth, I streamlined the code and added further functionaility like generic
                  tags and automatic documentation generation to the project. My background being that of 
                  a computer science student helped to a great extent in the process.
